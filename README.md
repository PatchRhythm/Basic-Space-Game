# My-First-Java-Game
My first Java game. Project is not complete and work in progress. 

This project will be the first of many projects, that spawn my coding skills, while having fun making games and exploring my coding skills. 

For the moment, I like Java and I'll keep committing stuff in Java. Seems logical to attempt to master a language that is multiplatform and has automatic memory management. Seems like a good language to make games in.
