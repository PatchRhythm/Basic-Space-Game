# This is just a demo. It is coded in Java version 1.8.0_91. All the code was typed and coded by me, and critiqued for accuracy.

This project is functional in the aspect of what I've learned so far. It still needs score tracking, enemy re-spawn, a menu system, game over when enemies are gone, and a restart button.

This project will be the first of many projects, that spawn my coding skills, while having fun making games and exploring my coding skills.

For the moment, I like Java and I'll keep committing stuff in Java. Seems logical to attempt to master a language that is multi-platform. Seems like a good language to make games in.

Basic instructions on how to run the game:

This is a simple Java JAR (compressed archive). Any system that has Java installed can run a program coded in Java without any special software. You should be able to just click or right click->open with->Oracle Java 8.

The game right now, destroys enemies but having the player collide with them directly using the arrow controlled player object, which in this case is a ship. I'm in the process of adding projectiles.

At the current screen size, I do not see any lag in movement or animation, which is a very good thing. :-)

The game runs as a basic program loop, it generates enemies, you quash them with your ship, and they disappear. Click on x to close, and feel free to run again.

Keep checking back for future improvements.
