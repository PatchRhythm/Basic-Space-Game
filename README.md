# My-First-Java-Game
My first Java game. Project is not 100% complete, and issue is mentioned in the issues section. Next project will have more features and hopefully not have anything unresolved. 

This project will be the first of many projects, that spawn my coding skills, while having fun making games and exploring my coding skills. 

For the moment, I like Java and I'll keep committing stuff in Java. Seems logical to attempt to master a language that is multiplatform and has automatic memory management. Seems like a good language to make games in.
