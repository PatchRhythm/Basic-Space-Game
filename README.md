# My-First-Java-Game
This is just a demo, and it does not currently have a re-spawn method, score, or a restart button. You just hit the x and run it again. But all the code was typed and coded by me, and critiqued for accuracy. 

This project will be the first of many projects, that spawn my coding skills, while having fun making games and exploring my coding skills. 

For the moment, I like Java and I'll keep committing stuff in Java. Seems logical to attempt to master a language that is multiplatform and has automatic memory management. Seems like a good language to make games in.
