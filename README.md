# Basic-Space-Game
This is just a demo. It is coded in Java version 1.8.0_91. All the code was typed and coded by me, and critiqued for accuracy. 

This project is functional in the aspect of what I've learned so far. It still needs score tracking, enemy re-spawn, a menu system, game over when enemies are gone, and a restart button. 

This project will be the first of many projects, that spawn my coding skills, while having fun making games and exploring my coding skills. 

For the moment, I like Java and I'll keep committing stuff in Java. Seems logical to attempt to master a language that is multi-platform. Seems like a good language to make games in.
